# Hi, I am Roshan!
#### PhD student @ Texas A&M/Computational Chemist @ Atom Bioworks Inc. 
#### My work focuses on using computers to understand how biomolecules interact.  
#### Apart from work I spend my days building ergonomic keyboards and playing squash/badminton.
#### Please follow my research work on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=m4Kzdj8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)  page and please contact for pdfs.
#### I plan to frequently blog about recent advances and my attempts at solving computational chemistry problems and building/using weird keyboards for work.
